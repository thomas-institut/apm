# Witness Schemata

## Foreword

There must be a data schema for the storage and exchange of collation tables and
their derivates for the purpose of editing, exporting and importing. 
The APM's API should only serve and accept objects that use this schema.

A stored collation table can be used
* as cache for automatic collations
* as the basis for editions
* as the basis for derivative witnesses
* on its own as an intermediate step before constructing an edition

The data in a collation table should allow the table's manipulation autonomously. 
Conceptually a collation table should be considered a stand alone document
even if its data was derived and is associated with other data in the system
(for example, most prominently, with manuscript transcriptions) and independently of how the
data is actually stored in the system. Only in this way can the 
stability of editions and derivative witnesses derived from a collation table
be guaranteed.

One scenario that should be avoided is that a stored collation table becomes inconsistent
or its data no longer supports the decisions made by editors due to a malfunction or a
change in the APM's data generation software. Even less desirable is the scenario where
the collation table depends on data that by definition is mutable, such as
the current status of a transcription that any user in the APM can change 
without restriction.  

Most changes to witness data are protected by the fact that APM witnesses refer
to the state of the transcription at a specific point in time. However, a change
in the itemization and tokenization algorithms can provoke unexpected changes. For
all intents and purposes, a change caused by a change in internal APM mechanisms
may provoke the same kinds of inconsistencies as changing a witness version. 

Many of these potential changes are seemingly easy to cope with. For example, 
a change in a token's information due to changes in the underlying items 
should normally require only a display change in the collation table edition tool and
some minor changes to whatever other information is generated out of the collation
table itself such as automatically generated apparatus entries. Even a change in a token's text 
is not dangerous. In fact, a simple change in the text of the token might be
the most common change caused by a version change since editors might just want
to correct obvious mistakes in the transcription.

More problematic is a change in the number of tokens. In that case, an update tool must try 
to match current tokens with the new ones so that resulting collation table matrix
make as much sense as possible. This, however, as a general rule should not be done
without telling the user about the changes. 

The strategy to handle changes therefore should be to allow the user, on command, to 
audit the witnesses underlying data using the latest APM data generation algorithm, or check
for updates in transcriptions. An update tool would then take over and calculate the 
potential changes to the collation table. The tool would determine and inform the user
of the changes to be made and ask the user to approve them. The most radical solution
would be to delete a witness from the table and then add it again losing all of the user's work 
for that witness.

## Informal Description

A  __collation table__ consists of:
* chunk ID: an identifier of the chunk in question. In the APM this is a 
  string of the form *AWxx-nnn* where *AWxx* is the work and *nnn* is the chunk
  number. Other applications can allow a different chunk identification 
  scheme.
* witnesses: an array of *m* witnesses where *m >= 2*, each one consisting at least of 
  a non-empty array of tokens (see description below). 
  * If the witness data includes a chunk ID, it must match the collation table's
    chunk ID.
* sigla: an array of *m* strings corresponding to each of the witnesses in the
  collation table:  *sigla[i]* ==> siglum for the witness *witnesses[i]*
    * Sigla could be stored within the witness' data, but it must not. 
      The siglum is actually metadata for a witness that only makes sense
      in the context of a collation table or one of its derived objects. Witness
      data must be only the data necessary to specify the witness on its own,
      independent of whether it is used in a collation table or not. 
* a collation matrix consisting of *m* rows and *n* columns, where 
    element *[i][j]* is either an integer that refers to token *j* of witness 
    *witnesses[i]* or the number -1 which is a reference to nothing 
    (an empty reference)
* title : a non-emtpy string
* author: author info, either a name or a standard author information
  object. 
* versionID: a string that identifies the version. In the APM this is normally
  a version number  
* language: two letter code (optional, desirable for display purposes)
  * If witness data include a language code, it must match the collation table's
    language.
* witnessDisplayOrder: an array of *m* integer elements such that 
  *witnessDisplayOrder[i]* is the witness array index that should be 
  displayed in position *i*. 

A __witness__ consists of:
* id: e.g. the Apm system id
* chunkId
* tokens: array of witness tokens
* type: e.g. simple, fullTx, edition
* type-dependent data

A __witness token__ consists of:
* text: a string
* normalization: an optional string
* type: WORD, PUNCTUATION, WHITESPACE
* 

__Author info__ can be:
* a string representing an author name and description. E.g. "Rafael NÃ¡jera 
   <rafa@email.com>"
* OR: a author info structure:
  * fullName: string (optional if the system can infer it from somewhere else)
  * firstName: string (optional)
  * emailAddress
  * a number of IDs: an associate array with different IDs. For example:
    
    `[ 'apmId' =>  123123, 'DFG' => 11232, 'WikiData' => 'asdfsd' ]`
    
  

The following is pertinent to APM collation tables editable by users:
* witnesses must be APM witnesses: as of now an fullTx witness with a timestamp 
* the only fields changeable by an external user after creation are: 
    * collation matrix
    * sigla
    * witnessDisplayOrder
    * title
    * any editable witness, e.g. an edition or a derivative witness
      * this may suggest that ALL data pertinent to an editable witness must
        be stored in a collation table. However, this 
* author is a system user Id and is normally determined by APM at save time
* versionId is a timestamp generated by the APM at save time
* there should be a process in place to handle recalculations of witness data
